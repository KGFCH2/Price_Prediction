## 📘 Project Overview

This is a **Mini Project** developed as part of our academic curriculum. It predicts the market prices of **seasonal crops** using machine learning techniques. We used crop price data from **2019 to 2023** and applied models like **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to predict future prices.

> **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

## 🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning-based model that:
- Analyzes historical seasonal crop prices
- Predicts future prices of categorized seasonal crops
- Compares model performance (SVM vs Random Forest) for each season
- Visualizes price trends using graphs

---

## 🍀 Seasonal Crop Classification

### ☀️ Summer Season Crops:
- **Bhindi (Ladies Finger)**        
- **Bitter Gourd**
- **Brinjal**
- **Mango**
- **Spinach**

### 🌧️ Rainy Season Crops:
- **Banana**
- **Guava**
- **Papaya**
- **Peach**
- **Plum**

### ❄️ Winter Season Crops:
- **Apple**
- **Beetroot**
- **Cabbage**
- **Carrot**
- **Cauliflower**
- **Orange**

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

For each season, we trained and tested:
- ✅ **Support Vector Regressor (SVM)**
- ✅ **Random Forest (RF)**

Model performance was evaluated using:
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

---

## 📈 Visualizations

We visualized:
- 📈 Actual vs Predicted Prices
- 🧭 Seasonal price trends
- 📊 Crop-wise comparison graphs using Seaborn & Matplotlib

## 🧰 Libraries Used

```bash
pandas
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
sklearn
